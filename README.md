# Image Processing with Numpy
## Project Overview
This project manipulates an image using array operations with Numpy.Using array operations uncovers the magic under the hood - highlighting the roles computations like slicing and resizing arrays play in image processing.


For a detailed explanation on the theory used for this computation, check out the accompanying [article on medium](https://medium.com/@ayoakinkugbe/numpylisa-10-image-processing-steps-using-numpy-f747534cc667)
